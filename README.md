# BETWEEN-TWO-SETS
This program calculates how many integers lie "between" two sets, meaning each integer is a multiple of all numbers in set **a** and also a divisor of all numbers in set **b**. It works by finding the LCM of **a**, the GCD of **b**, and then counting how many multiples of the LCM evenly divide the GCD.
